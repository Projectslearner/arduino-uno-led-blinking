# arduino uno led blinking
Arduino Uno, a popular microcontroller board, can blink an LED with simple code. Connect an LED to pin 13 with a resistor. In the Arduino IDE, write a program to set pin 13 as output, then toggle it HIGH and LOW with delay for blinking effect. Upload and watch the LED blink!

# Blink LED Arduino Uno
Description:
This Arduino sketch blinks an LED connected to pin 13 on the Arduino Uno board. It demonstrates a basic example of digital output using Arduino.

# Hardware Required:
Arduino Uno board
LED
220-ohm resistor
Breadboard
Jumper wires

# Instructions:
Connect the positive (longer) leg of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino Uno via a 220-ohm resistor.
Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Uno.
Upload this sketch to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
Watch the LED connected to pin 13 blink on and off at one-second intervals.
