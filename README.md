# 1. LED Glow with Arduino:

# Components:

- Arduino Board
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard 
- Jumper Wires

# Instructions

1. Connect the LED and Resistor:

- Place the LED on the breadboard.
- Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to pin 9 on the Arduino.
- Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to one end of the 220-ohm resistor.
- Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino.

2.Power the Arduino:

- Plug the Arduino into a USB port or power it with an external adapter.

3.Observe the LED:

- The LED should light up once the Arduino is powered.
